#Automapper for Dungeon Master

This is an automapper / automap mod for Dungeon Master and Chaos Strikes Back. Currently this works only with Amiga version of the game. Dungeon Master 3.6 and Chaos Strikes Back 3.5 were tested (more specifically, WHDLoad versions of these games), but other versions might work too.
